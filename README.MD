# Toilet

This repository contains the implementation of an OpenFOAM model for the case of a flush toilet ðŸš½. It uses `interIsoFoam` to solve the free surface, and URANS treatment to solve the turbulence, using the `kOmegaSST` model.

## Getting Started

* Run the `prepare.sh` to generate the mesh and set up the simulation.
* Then run the case with `interIsoFoam`

## Results
